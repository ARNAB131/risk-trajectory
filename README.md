Risk Trajectory — Full Build (Python + Ruby backend, HTML/CSS/JS frontend)
Below is a complete, runnable baseline that implements:

Continuous vitals stream (simulated)

Patient-specific baselines + thresholds

Multi-level risk (Green/Yellow/Orange/Red)

Trend-based detection (rate-of-change + rolling window)

Outcome inference (rule-based “risk engine” with explainability)

Event timeline / audit log (SQLite)

Real-time dashboard updates via WebSocket

Notification service in Ruby (email-ready stub + logging)
